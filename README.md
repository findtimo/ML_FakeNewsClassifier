# Fake News Classifier

The Fake News Classifier is a machine learning model trained to identify fake news from a sample data set obtained from Kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrisdal/fake-news).
This project was created to better understand how machine learning models are formed and to contribute to the field of artificial learning.


â€‹The project was developed using Jupyter Lab and coded in Python, being heavily dependent on the sklearn import.
It uses natural language processing techniques and a logistic regression algorithm, over the decision tree classifier, to classify news articles as either real or fake.

The PowerPoint file included dives into the specifications of the file and provides in-depth analysis of each model type.
